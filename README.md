## About

This project is part of [TheOdinProject](https://www.theodinproject.com/https://github.com/TheOdinProject) curriculum. The project's lesson can be found [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-tic-tac-toe). The goal of this project was to practice Factory Functions and IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expressions) aka The Module Pattern.

I've made a [Figma mockup](https://www.figma.com/file/0P2BoffQJ3oIbEZyz2cmQ0/tic-tac-toe?type=design&node-id=82%3A140&mode=design&t=0MZhjFTPfEXSdpJP-1) that I've used as the starting point.
